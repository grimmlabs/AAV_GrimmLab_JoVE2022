This repository provides the necessary documents for the bioinformatic analysis of barcoded capsids libraries as described in the publication: "Isolation of next-generation gene therapy vectors through engineering, barcoding and screening of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variants", Rapti K et al., 2022. There are two folders in this repository.

The first folder contains two scripts used for a peptide display analysis. Script#1 is an mildly edited version of Script#1 that can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/JonasWeinmann/AAV-barcode-detection-and-normalization. It is updated for python3. Script#2 is original and used only in this publication.

The second folder contains the example input and output files.
