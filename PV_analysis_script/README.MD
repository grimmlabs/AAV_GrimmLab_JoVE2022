# AAV_JoVE_KR_peptidedisplayanalysis
This repository provides the necessary documents for the bioinformatic analysis of peptide display libraries as described in the publication: 
"Isolation of next-generation gene therapy vectors through engineering, barcoding and screening of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid variants", Rapti K et al., 2022.
There are two folders in this repository.

The first folder contains two scripts used for a peptide display analysis. 
Script#1 is an mildly edited version of Script#1 that can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/JonasWeinmann/AAV-barcode-detection-and-normalization. It is updated for python3. 
Script#2 is original and used only in this publication.

The second folder contains the input and output files used in the two scripts.
